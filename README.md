# Iris-Classification
This is simple project of Machine Learning using Python.
# Objective
The objective here is to classify a given Iris flower (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)) as one among the three classes of the given Iris species and find its most and the least important feature. The categorisation is done on the basis of four parameters already known to us i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 
# How do we approach?
1. We need a dataset of Iris flower species. I have got such a dataset from Kaggle - www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
2. We use Supervised Learning algorithm here. Why? 
   We use the Supervised Learning algorithm because we already know the input and the output obtained here.
3. Model used here is the Linear Regression model. This model depicts the linear relationship between the input data and the output data.
